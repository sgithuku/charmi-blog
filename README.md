## Automatic Colors

By default the hover overlay of the grid image and the header on the project page automatically choose its color by using [react-palette](https://github.com/leonardokl/react-palette).
The plugin chooses the *vibrant* color of the image and applies it as the ``background-color`` for the hover overlay and header background. If you don't want that behavior you can delete the ``<Palette />`` component both from ``pages/index.jsx`` and ``templates/project.jsx``. -->
